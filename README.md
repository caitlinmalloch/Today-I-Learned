# Today I Learned

## Overview

Today I Learned is a full-stack web application that allows users to add to an existing database of facts, sorted by category. The facts must use a reliable source that is shared with the fact and users can dispute a fact by voting false under the fact, which will be reviewed by the administrator. Users can also vote for the fact being "interesting" and "mind-blowing".

Current categories include:

- Technology
- Science
- Finance
- Society
- Entertainment
- Health
- History
- News
